# Project Name
Brandi Tungett's Resume

## Description

personal website / resume / portfolio


## Bootstrap Usage

Bootstrap was used heavily throughout the project in order to provide responsive design and overall formatting of the project. Key functions used were the navbar option and the card formatting for content tiles.


## Custom CSS Classes

The class(es) I created are:

`.babc`
brandi's awesome background color: describes the background color for the body of all pages

`.bordcol`
border color: unoriginal name for border color for the navbar links, but also includes other border attributes

`.bmt-header`
provides background and text color for the header in my content cards


## Custom JavaScript Functions

I wrote a custom Javascript function in custom.js for my contact page. The function is used for form validation.
